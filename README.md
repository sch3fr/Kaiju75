# Kaiju75
Kaiju75 will be an ISO 75% split keyboard, designed to be 3D printed and hand wired.
## Some questions, some anwers
- Q: Do we need another open source keyboard?
- A: No. But I like building keyboards, and I'm too cheap to order actuall kit for > 200â‚¬.
Plus none of the keyboards in the 3D printed, hand wired niche suits my needs. 
I mean there could never be enough ISO keyboards, and split on top of that? There is like, one.
And it's only 60% I need my F row dammit!
- Q: Why kaiju? <br>
- A: Because I am a huge nerd, love Pacific Rim, and got GMK Kaiju keycaps for cheap <br>
- Q: How complex is this thing gonna be?
- A: I ain't no engineer here, simple matrix with diodes and two Pro Micros runnig QMK, 
should be easy enough (famous last words)
## Plan for the project
- [x] Design a keymap
- [ ] Design a case using real CAD software, no Tinkercad this time
- [ ] Make a wiring plan
- [ ] Write firmware
- [ ] Print it, wire it, flash it, use it
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
## Current state of the project
Welcome to the very beginning of Mr. Bones wild ride. I am doing this project as a means 
of relaxing while finishing by Bc. degree, so this is purely free-time-once-a-week-maybe 
kind of thing. Honestly I think I want this to be somewhat similar to the Ultimate 
Hacking Keyboard, just with more keys. I'm not sure if I'd prefer 75 or 65, guess I'll 
have to build 65 keyboard next.<br>
I'm currently being distractedy by lubing switches. Uh oh.
