# Notes
- [Matt3o](https://matt3o.com/) recomends 4mm plate thickness for 3D printed keyboards,
however Cherry style switches need the plate to be 1.5mm thick so it can snap to 
the plate, otherwise I'll end up pulling out both keycaps and the switches
# Log
- Project is still alive as of January 30th, I was just very busy with my exams, thesis, and the wohle my-3d-printer-exploded kind of thing, however I did manage to get a little better in OpenSCAD, I hope to start active work on this project in February
